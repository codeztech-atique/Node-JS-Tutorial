Working in Microsoft Word, I often need some “junk” text to play around with, for various reasons:

* I’m designing a document and don’t want to get bogged down in what the text actually says.

* I’m creating a template with various paragraph styles and need to see what they will look like.

* I’m creating a macro and need some text for testing purposes.

* I’m trying to learn more about some feature of Microsoft Word and don’t want to practice on a real document.
